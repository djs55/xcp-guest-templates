guest-templates for Debian
--------------------------

The XCP Appliance version of this package will generate the templates on the
first system boot. Since we need to be able to 1) generate templates
immediately after the package is installed, and 2) be able to do so when xapi
isn't yet running, we'll need to change how and when we create templates.
